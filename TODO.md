1. Properly configure dependency closures (style dictionary dependencies should be in the build closure, not runtime)
1. Add template for obj-c header file https://github.com/alexito4/Sketch-Color-Theme-Plugin/tree/master/Example
1. Make actions return before performing the next action (useful for async processes)
1. Clean up templates/formats/transforms
1. Document easy dependency/importing of style dictionaries
1. Add versioning to style dictionaries
1. Weblab/variant support?
1. Make build/test cycle better. If you are developing locally, to make a change to the style dictionary you have to build that package and then some downstream dependency to see the change in a real UI.
1. Add color/size difference calculations
1. Add support for transparencies
1. Add support for variable references
1. Add mixin format/template
